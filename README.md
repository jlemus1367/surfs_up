# Surfs Up with SQLAlchemy

## Project Overview
The following project involves using SQLAlchemy in conjunction with an SQLite database to determine the viability of a Surf n' Shake shop in Oahu, Hawaii. A surf shop with a similar concept had previously flopped due to the weather conditions. To avoid the same fate, we must determine whether the weather conditions are optimal for the venture to succeed. By querying an SQLite database containing weather data with the power of python and its dependencies, we will analyze the weather patterns of Oahu to decide if the conditions are sustainable for our business venture.
